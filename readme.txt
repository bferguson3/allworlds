Synopsis:
Your name is Alistair and you have been in magical stasis for 30 years, but you have lost your memory. Through the main quest, which involves purifying the planet's Shrines from Horrors, you uncover your past, a long, painful childhood of magical enhancements and mutations which have given you superhuman ability. (Essentially you have been crafted since birth to battle the Horrors.)

The Horrors are abstracted negative human emotion that correspond to the shrine's name, i.e. Innocence is overtaken by a horror that embodies carnal sin.

The companions you find are similar to yourself.

Rain - Fighter
Has been put into stasis 3 times, putting his age at 129 years, 39 actual. Big beefy guy, bare arms, long hair, scars, metal cuirass, leather pants, boots, 2h sword on his back. Doesn't seem to care he has forgotten his past three times.

Theresa - Rogue
Has never been put into stasis, thus has all her memories. Hooded, small cape, leather armor, bare legs, stylish boots. Set of daggers across her abdomen, bow/quiver on her back. Trained with the Silver Daggers (international thieves guild) since childhood, was chosen to be mutated for her natural ability. The Silver Daggers offer a student once every 30 years to keep their influence and protect themselves from a mass arrest.

Victoria - Mage
First time in stasis, like you. Tight blue dress, slit up the legs and V-neck, choker, long brown hair, made-up, belt of potions, staff w/jagged crystal. Is very unhappy at having lost her memories, somewhat unwilling to cooperate in the quest. 

The ending is, once all the shrines are purified, you must undertake the Pilgrimage. This leads you deep within the earth where you find the truth - horrors and monsters are a human creation, born from their incurable desire to cause evil. You are trapped and put into stasis and your memories are wiped.
