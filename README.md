Synopsis:<br>
Your name is Alistair and you have been in magical stasis for 30 years, <br>
but you have lost your memory. Through the main quest, which involves <br>
purifying the planet's Shrines from Horrors, you uncover your past, a <br>
long, painful childhood of magical enhancements and mutations which have <br>
given you superhuman ability. (Essentially you have been crafted since <br>
birth to battle the Horrors.)<br>
<br>
The Horrors are abstracted negative human emotion that correspond to the <br>
shrine's name, i.e. Innocence is overtaken by a horror that embodies carnal sin.<br>
<br>
The companions you find are similar to yourself.<br>
<br>
Rain - Fighter<br>
Has been put into stasis 3 times, putting his age at 129 years, 39 actual. <br>
Big beefy guy, bare arms, long hair, scars, metal cuirass, leather pants, <br>
boots, 2h sword on his back. Doesn't seem to care he has forgotten his past <br>
three times.<br>
<br>
Theresa - Rogue<br>
Has never been put into stasis, thus has all her memories. Hooded, small <br>
cape, leather armor, bare legs, stylish boots. Set of daggers across her <br>
abdomen, bow/quiver on her back. Trained with the Silver Daggers (international <br>
thieves guild) since childhood, was chosen to be mutated for her natural ability. <br>
The Silver Daggers offer a student once every 30 years to keep their influence <br>
and protect themselves from a mass arrest.<br>
<br>
Victoria - Mage<br>
First time in stasis, like you. Tight blue dress, slit up the legs and V-neck, <br>
choker, long brown hair, made-up, belt of potions, staff w/jagged crystal. <br>
Is very unhappy at having lost her memories, somewhat unwilling to cooperate in the quest. <br>
<br>
The ending is, once all the shrines are purified, you must undertake the <br>
Pilgrimage. This leads you deep within the earth where you find the truth - <br>
horrors and monsters are a human creation, born from their incurable desire to <br>
cause evil. You are trapped and put into stasis and your memories are wiped.<br>
